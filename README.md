# Simple CAlculator WebApp using REACT

It can take multiple operands and operators

Major operations used:-
-"eval"
-"onClick"
-"setState"(/useState)
- Normal CSS styles, such as
  height,width,cursor type,display etc.


If i had more time i would have implemented more functions into 
this , like a "scientific calculator"...

I took help from the internet for css Styling and then implemented it..
